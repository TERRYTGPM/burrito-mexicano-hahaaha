Think of the burrito as the sum of its parts. The ingredients are simple, but each one plays an important role in the overall taste. 

For most people, what makes a burrito so appealing is how easy it is - you can eat it quickly and itâ€™s a delicious, tasty and satisfying meal. 

To cut down on prep time, make your meat filling in advance - a slow cooker is ideal for this. Cooking in batches means you can also freeze extra portions to save for later. 

Don't be afraid to go beyond the classic ingredients - adding your own spin with fresh ingredients means you can enjoy your favourite dish dozens of different ways. 

For a kick of heat, add jalapenos - you can add them to stir fried vegetables like peppers and onions if you're making a veggie burrito or simply slice and add as part of the garnish. 

Though meat is the standard filling, you can easily transform a burrito into a vegetarian or vegan dish by swapping out a few ingredients. Instead of meat, you can add sweet potato to make your burrito satisfying and filling. 

Chocolate is another way to add a secret twist to your burrito recipe. It pairs beautifully with chilli to make a rich sauce that highlights all the other delicious flavours.
