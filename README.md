How to make burritos

Let’s start with the basics: what exactly is a burrito? 

Put simply: a burrito is a Mexican wrap. A flour tortilla is filled with refried beans and other toppings, then wrapped into a closed cylinder and served. 

Burrito literally translates to “little donkey” in Spanish, which could refer to the round bedrolls commonly carried by donkeys in Mexico.  

The exact history of the burrito is unknown, though it grew in popularity around the nineteenth century with Mexican Americans, particularly in California. Farmworkers would often prepare a burrito of beans and salsa as an easy lunch.
